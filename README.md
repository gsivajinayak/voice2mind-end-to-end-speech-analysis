# üß† Voice2Mind: End-to-End Speech_Analysis with Mental Health Detection

This repository presents an advanced **End-to-End Speech Analysis System** that integrates **Speech-to-Text (STT)**, **Grammar Correction**, **Mental Health Detection**, and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** to build an intelligent and empathetic AI pipeline.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

The goal of **Voice2Mind** is to enable a system that can:
- Listen to user audio,
- Transcribe it into text,
- Correct grammatical errors,
- Detect the user‚Äôs mental health state from their speech content,
- And finally, respond with a natural human-like voice.

This project bridges **speech understanding** and **mental state analysis**, making it useful for **healthcare, emotion analysis, and conversational AI**.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains **user-generated text posts** labeled into 7 mental health categories:

| Label | Description |
|:------|:-------------|
| Anxiety | Fear, panic, overthinking |
| Bipolar | Mood swings, manic/depressive tone |
| Depression | Sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest |
| Normal | Neutral emotional tone |
| Personality Disorder | Inconsistent or extreme emotions |
| Stress | Overload, tension, pressure |
| Suicidal | Expressions of self-harm or suicide |

### üßπ Preprocessing Steps:
- Removed stopwords, emojis, and URLs  
- Normalized casing and punctuation  
- Tokenized text sequences  
- Balanced classes (oversampling minority classes)

---

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We performed:
- Class distribution visualizations (bar + pie charts)  
- Word clouds for each mental health class  
- Text length histograms  
- Most frequent terms per label  

*(Add visuals under `/assets/` ‚Äî like `class_distribution.png`, `wordcloud.png`, etc.)*

## üß™ Models Implemented

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Whisper (STT)
- Model: OpenAI Whisper (small/medium)  
- Function: Converts audio ‚Üí text with robust noise handling  
- Accuracy: >95% transcription accuracy on clean speech  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Grammar Correction (Transformer)
- Model: T5-small / BERT fine-tuned for grammatical correction  
- Example:
  - Input: *‚ÄúHe go to school yesterday.‚Äù*  
  - Output: *‚ÄúHe went to school yesterday.‚Äù*

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Mental Health Detection
- Model: **DistilBERT** (Transformer)  
- Accuracy: **91.06%**  
- Macro F1-score: **0.91**
- Additional models: BiLSTM + Word2Vec, Ensemble ML (XGBoost + RF)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Model: Coqui TTS / pyttsx3  
- Output: High-quality speech synthesis (offline supported)
